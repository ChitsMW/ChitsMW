### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a new Software Developer and very excited to be on this journey!

ðŸŒ± I learned algorithm and programming basics with Tech Elevator where I graduated in February 2024

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving my coding skills
âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be an architecture and sustainable design professor
